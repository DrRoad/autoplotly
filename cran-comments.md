Package was archived on CRAN

CRAN repository db overrides:
  X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2018-01-27 as it depends on the archived
    'ggfortify'.
```

This is essentially the same as the previous version v0.1.0. The previous version was archived since the main dependency `ggfortify` was archived.

## Reverse dependencies

This is the same as the first release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
