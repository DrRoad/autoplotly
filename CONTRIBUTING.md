# Contributing guidelines

This package is still in an early development stage. Some details in the
visualizations may not look as perfect yet. We welcome suggestions and
contributions from others. With this package, researchers will hopefully spend
less time focusing on learning `ggplot2` syntax or interactive visualization
packages like `plotly`. Instead they can spend more time on their work and
research. The source code of the package is located on
[Github](https://github.com/terrytangyuan/autoplotly) where users can test out
development versions of the package and provide feature requests, feedback and
bug reports. We encourage you to submit your issues and pull requests to help us
make this package better for the R community. In the future, we'll try to
support a much wider range of objects through a larger coverage in `ggfortify`.
If you find any new use cases, please don't hesitate to submit an issue on
Github and join us in the development!

Currently, this package is highly dependent on [ggfortify
package](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify) so most of the underlying
implementation happens there. Please take a look ggfortify's contributing
guideline located [here](https://github.com/sinhrks/ggfortify/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). This
repository should mainly focus on tracking issues related to autoplotly or bug
fixes regarding the current implementation to support extensibility using
additional `ggplot2` or `plotly` syntax.
